# Gradescope Duedate Extension
To install:
1. download repository as a zip file
2. unzip (may not be necessary, but do so to be safe)
3. go to `chrome://extensions`
4. enable developer mode
5. click "load unpacked extension" and select the folder that came from the zip file you downloaded
6. Now courses on Gradescope should rank assignments in the order in which they are due (but you can still manually filter by however you want.)
7. You can hide completed assignments by clicking the extension icon, and click it again to reshow it. This setting persists across reloads, so if you don't want to see the completed stuff, you don't need to click it every single time you visit the page (but you are still able to later if you need to access it for regrades or something).
